# Portfolio Mockup Udacity

This is my first project after learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The goal was to view a mockup and then create the mockup using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap(optional). After Following the mockup, we were instrcuted to use our own creativity in color, additional sections, and features.
